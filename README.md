### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cole Hamiton,

And to fund the bill for my homelab I manage a team of Support Specialists for a global software firm that specializes in online payments and marketing. 

In my spare time I enjoy exploring new ideas in data storage, file systems, organization methods, networking, automation and security.
